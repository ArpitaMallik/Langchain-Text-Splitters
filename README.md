# 🧠 Text Splitting in LangChain

This repository explores different techniques for text splitting using [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) — a framework for building applications with large language models (LLMs). Text splitting is a foundational step when working with long documents, especially for tasks like summarization, retrieval, question answering, and more.

## 📌 Why Text Splitting?

Language models have a limited context window, meaning they can only process a certain number of tokens at a time. Feeding raw, lengthy documents directly into an LLM can lead to:

- Truncation of important content
- Increased latency and cost
- Decreased performance in downstream tasks

Text splitting helps overcome these issues by dividing content into manageable and meaningful chunks before processing.

## 📚 Types of Text Splitting in LangChain

LangChain provides several text splitting strategies, each suited to different kinds of data and use cases. Below are the four primary categories:

---

### 1. 🔢 Length-Based Splitting

This method splits text based on a fixed number of characters or tokens, regardless of the content's structure or meaning.

- Chunks are typically uniform in size.
- Commonly used when no natural structure is available in the data.
- Fast and simple, but may cut through sentences or paragraphs unnaturally.

---

### 2. 🏗️ Text-Structure-Based Splitting

This strategy uses natural textual structures such as newlines, paragraphs, or markdown headers to split content.

- Maintains logical groupings of text (e.g., sections, sub-sections).
- Well-suited for blog posts, documentation, or any content with markdown formatting.
- Improves readability and preserves context better than fixed-length splits.

---

### 3. 📄 Document-Structure-Based Splitting

This approach considers how the content is organized in the source document itself — like pages in a PDF or sections in a Word file.

- Commonly used when loading documents through loaders like `PyPDFLoader` or `UnstructuredFileLoader`.
- Maintains metadata (e.g., page numbers) during splitting.
- Useful when layout or page-based references are important.

### 4. 🧠 Semantic Meaning-Based Splitting

This advanced method uses text embeddings to split documents based on semantic similarity.

- Chunks are divided at natural topic boundaries or logical shifts in meaning.
- Ideal for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), semantic search, or QA tasks.
- Provides higher-quality chunks, especially for knowledge-intensive domains.

---

## 🚀 Use Cases

- Chatbots over long documents (e.g., PDFs, legal texts)
- Summarization of research papers or reports
- Improving LLM-based retrieval systems
- Custom chunking for fine-tuning or prompting

---

## 🧩 Requirements

Make sure to install the required libraries for running LangChain text splitters, such as:

- `langchain`
- `langchain-community`
- `pypdf` (for PDFs)
- `tiktoken` (for token-level control)
- `openai` (if using semantic embedding-based methods)
